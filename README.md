# About the project


This project will be a skills management system where users can create a profile with their soft and hard skills inside.

With this information project leaders will be able to sort users by skills so they can build an optimal team for the project needs.

# Development

For now the development of this application will use MySQL (database), NodeJS with Express and TypeORM (api).

# Development Status

Currently I'm almost done with the API creation.
