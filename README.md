# About the project


This project will be a skills management system where users can create a profile with their soft and hard skills inside.

With this information project leaders will be able to sort users by skills so they can build an optimal team for the project needs.

# Development

The development of this application will use MySQL (database), NodeJS with Express and TypeORM (api), React (Web App) and React Native (Mobile App).

# Development Status

I'm done with the API for now, and started the Web App development with React
